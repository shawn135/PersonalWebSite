        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is an aws project to design a Scalable E-Commerce Platform using AWS services, including Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS, Docker, and EC2.</p>
        <h2>Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Built a Python-based microservice hosted in a Docker container, integrating it with an AWS-backed infrastructure for seamless API communication.</li>
            <li>Configured a highly available architecture with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.</li>
            <li>Leveraged IAM roles, security groups, and VPC configurations to ensure a secure and isolated environment.</li>
            <li>Deployed a Dockerized application to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and integrated it with an RDS MySQL database for persistent storage.</li>
            <li>Automated resource provisioning using AWS CloudFormation to enable reproducibility and minimize manual setup.</li>
            <li>Tested the application locally using Docker and exposed services for API testing, ensuring reliability before deployment.</li>
        </ul>
